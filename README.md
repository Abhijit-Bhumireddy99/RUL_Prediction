# RUL_Prediction
Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is an estimate of remaining time that a machine or a system or a mechanical element is able to function according to it's expected purpose before calling for replacement.

Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction makes use of prediction methods or prediction models to predict the future performance of a machine and to obtain the available time left for a machine to work properly without causing failure.

# Publication on Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Mechanical Bearings using Convolution Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory
This research article focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Mechanical Bearings. I along with my teammate developed a data-driven methodology that incorporates Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction. Below attached the research paper link for reference.
